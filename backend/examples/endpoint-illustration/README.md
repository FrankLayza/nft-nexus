# Endpoint Usage Example

This directory contains a few example JSONs and scripts to illustrate how to interact with the agent core through the provided endpoints.

## Usage

First, run the backend server and ensure the port number used corresponds to the one used in the scripts.

Second, run the `prepare_agent.sh` script to create the agent and put it into the RUNNING state.

Finally, run the `trigger_agent.sh` script to trigger execution of the agent. You can run this multiple times.
